# Writing-Analysis
Data Structures Final Project 2019, but still the best project there'll ever be
A trie, each completed word points to a vertex and its list of edges. Each edge points to a vertex and has a weight (number of times that vertex/word appears after the list's vertex). 
(Dorothea) Save functionality will go through trie alphabetically, reading words and edge lists into a save file. Read in save file function will read in word/vertices and their edges, making a new trie.
(Spas) Driver function will use text clean functions to remove punctuation and capitalizations to pass into trie.
(Jake) hpp file contains list of graph functions.
